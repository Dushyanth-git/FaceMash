# FaceMash
FaceSmash is a web application inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's original FaceMash website. It allows users to upload images of their friends and have them rated by other users. The app features a simple yet engaging rating system to determine the popularity of each user's photo based on the number of votes it receives.
